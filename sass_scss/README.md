## Description

This project consists of solving a series of tasks related to Sass/Scss. Each task involves writing Sass/Scss code to achieve a specific styling objective. Tasks include topics such as variables, nesting, mixins, extend/inheritance, loops, media queries, and more.

## Installation

To run the Sass/Scss files in this project, you need to have Sass installed on your system. If you're using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, you can install Sass using the following commands:

## Usage

Each task is provided in a separate `.scss` file. You can compile and run these files using the Sass compiler. For example:

sass [filename].scss
```

Replace `[filename]` with the name of the Sass file you want to compile.
